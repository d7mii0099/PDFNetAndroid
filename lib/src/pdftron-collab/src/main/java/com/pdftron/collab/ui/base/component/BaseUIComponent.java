/**
 * A {@link BaseUIComponent} describes a UI component on the screen, which could be a part of an
 * activity or fragment (basically anything that is a {@link LifecycleOwner}. The main responsibility
 * of the {@link BaseUIComponent} is to define the business logic of its views and maintain the data
 * associated with the views.
 *
 * <p>
 * The data for {@link BaseUIComponent} is contained within a {@link ViewModel} object.
 * Updates to the data can be observed directly by the {@link BaseUIComponent}, or by the caller if
 * needed (usually a {@link Fragment} or an {@link android.app.Activity}).
 * <p>
 * Android views are handled by a {@link BaseUIView} object. The only responsibilities of this object
 * are to inflate the views and to emit user interaction events to the component.
 * User interaction is captured through {@link BaseUIEvent}s and these events can be observed
 * directly by the {@link BaseUIComponent}, or by the caller.
